# music_media_API

RESTful API for Music Media Project using Django with Tastypie

Music Media (working name) is a social media platform based on bridging the gap between Spotify and Apple Music while also filling the role that is noticeably missing from the cast of popular apps - a platform entirely dedicated to the sharing and curating of songs.

Initially developed in under 24 hours as part of the inaguaral Howdy Hack competition at Texas A&M University.
